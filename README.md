# Assignment Synergy Labs

Assignment Synergy Labs is a modern web application that demonstrates efficient data handling and user management using the latest technologies. This project showcases a user interface for managing users with functionalities for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) user data.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React helps in creating reusable UI components and managing application state efficiently.
- **Vite:** A build tool that provides a fast development environment with lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR). Vite is used to set up and manage the development workflow.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application. Tailwind CSS allows for rapid UI development with pre-defined classes for styling.
- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static types. TypeScript helps in writing more maintainable and error-free code by providing type safety.
- **React Icons:** A collection of popular icon libraries, used to integrate icons easily into the React application.
- **axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend. Axios simplifies data fetching and handling.
- **react-router-dom:** A library for handling routing in React applications. It enables navigation between different views or pages within the application.

## Features

- **Fetch Data:** Retrieve user data from an external service and display it within the application.
- **CRUD Operations:** Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities to manage user data effectively.
